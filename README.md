# RL Documentation

## How it works
Since the start of the project season reinforcement learning team has gone on a journey, through both theory and practical applications.
Our load and savior, David Silver has been kind enough to deliver the basics to RL in 'easily digestable' lecture format. It has not been 
without its struggles. I would reccomend learning the basics well (especially terminology) before continuing or else you might feel overwhelmed. 

## Project Timeline
1. Get DDQN to work
2. Implement A2C
3. Implement PPO
4. Teach my dog to sit using RL algorithms
5. Teach my car to pick-up KFC using RL algorithms
6. Teach brain to live a long and happy life with RL algorithms
7. Ascend to a higher state of being

## How to contribute
1. Join DN
2. Undergo the 12-week Navy Seals training program
3. Prove to the team that you have implemented time travel from first principles

## Requirements
1. Pytorch: We like this network
2. cmake: cmake
3. wandb: Weights and Biases
4. Numpy: Numbers of Py
5. Math: The math boi
