# RL Documentation

## Project Timeline
1. Get DDQN to work
2. Implement A2C
3. Implement PPO
4. Teach my dog to sit using RL algorithms
5. Teach my car to pick-up KFC using RL algorithms
6. Teach brain to live a long and happy life with RL algorithms
7. Ascend to a higher state of being

## How to contribute
1. Join DN
2. Undergo the 12-week Navy Seals training program
3. Prove to the team that you have implemented time travel from first principles

## Requirements
1. Pytorch: We like this network
2. cmake: cmake
3. wandb: Weights and Biases
4. Numpy: Numbers of Py
5. Math: The math boi
